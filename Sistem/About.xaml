					<Run Text="A while ago I was re-introduced to stereograms on Reddit's /r/MagicEye. I've played around with creating some of these a long time ago and I thought it would be fun to try some again. As it turns out not much software is available to render these. Or, at least, not for free or the way I like it. I'm very picky that way."/>

					<Run Text="I've looked around for algorithms in existing software and found Andrej Olejnik's TStereogram from 1999. I've translated the algorithms into C# and updated them to make better use of the floating-point power we have these days. I've also included parallel processing. Not much is left of Andrej's work, but it gave me a head-start on generating these things."/>

					<Run Text="This is a hobby project. It fits my needs and gave me a few fun challenges. It's a constant work in progress, for example it has a Layers tab that doesn't really do anything. Will I ever do something with it? Who knows, right now I have other things to do!"/>

					<Run Text="This software is free and without support. If you know how stereograms work it should be pretty straighforward. Some parameters probably need some experimenting to find the proper values for a good stereogram. Bugs and improvements can be reported by leaving me a PM on Reddit. However, this project is pretty low-prio for me so no guarantees there!"/>
